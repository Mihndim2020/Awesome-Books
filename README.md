# Awesome-Books
In this project, I build a basic website that allows users to add/remove books from a list. I will achieve this by using JavaScript objects, arrays and classes to dynamically modify the DOM and add basic events. I am also going to use webpack a JavaScripte module bundler for module bundling.
